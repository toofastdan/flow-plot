# flow-plot
This is a quick program that will use python's seaborn data visualization library to plot a scatterplot from csv files exported from the FlowJo software.  It plots protein expression data for individual cells.

The purpose of this project to the be able to plot protein expression data without a FlowJo USB license key (which costs over $1000).  The FlowJo sotfware has limited figure making options and will not allow you make make figures without hte USB license key.  However, FlowJo will allow people to export a raw csv file with all the data bundled in.  Seaborn will allow us to make customizable, publication-grade figures without having to rely on overly-expensive software with limited figure making ability.
